# Calculator App

This repository is dedicated to storing my learning project, named calc_app. It focuses on building a simple yet functional calculator application using Alpine.js and Bootstrap. The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of Alpine.js for reactive components and Bootstrap for responsive design. Through this project, I've explored how to handle basic arithmetic operations, manage the user interface effectively, and ensure the application adapts well to different screen sizes. It's a practical step in improving my front-end development skills, particularly in creating interactive, user-friendly web applications.
